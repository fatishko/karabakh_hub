**Karabakh Hub** is a comprehensive digital bridge designed for the "Smart Village" reconstruction projects in Karabakh. Developed during the **"Green Karabakh" Hackathon 2025**, this project secured **2nd Place** for its innovative approach to social and economic integration.

## 🌟 Our Mission
While infrastructure (solar panels, smart grids) is vital, a village is defined by its people. Our mission is to bridge the gap between high-tech hardware and human connection. We aim to build a **Resilient Community** and provide **Direct Economic Support** to the residents of Karabakh's new smart villages.
